# Introduction 
*DeeBee* is a library providing Object Relational Mapping (ORM) support to applications, libraries, and frameworks. 

*DeeBee* specializes in abstracting away from the tedious process of writing in SQL for managing your databases. These abstractions are provided by extension methods over the [DbContext Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.entity.dbcontext?view=entity-framework-6.2.0), making *DeeBee* the perfect tool to use for projects with basic CRUD requirements. It does not require much ceremony and set up to start using!


# Installation 
There are two [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SimplyWorks.DeeBee/) packages for *DeeBee*, one being for the service, installed with:
```csharp
dotnet add package SimplyWorks.DeeBee 
```
While the other is used to integrate it into the dependency injection, with: 
```csharp
dotnet add package SimplyWorks.DeeBee.Extensions
```
